A console application that:
- Prints ‘hello world’ (or any other text) in the console.
- and monitors the mouse movement: 
When the cursor enters the console window area, the colour of the text in the console changes, and the current time is written to a log file with the ‘Enter’ tag.
When the cursor leaves the console window area, the colour of the text in the console changes to the original colour and the current time is written to the log file with the ‘Leave’ tag.
The Observer pattern is used.
